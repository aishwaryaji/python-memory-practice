# python-memory-practice
This repository covers core concepts of python which includes data structures, loops, functions and file handling for building a strong Python programming foundation

The intent of this is to keep tabs of my practice work to increase my knowlegde in python. The goal is Data Analysis and problem solving using Python.
Topics that are covered: 
                  Variables and Data Types,
                  List, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries,
                  Conditional Statements,
                  Loops,
                  Functions,
                  File Handling, 
                  Basic Problem-solving exercise,

Structure:
lists_practice.py,
loops_exercises.py,
functions_basics.py,
dictionary_operation.py,
file_handling_practice.py

Skills demonstrated: Logical Thinking, Code Structure, Understanding Python Syntax, Problem Solving Approach.
Through this, I strengthened my understanding the basis for Data Analysis.
